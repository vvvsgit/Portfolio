///what performance problem can result from using function templates and class templates?

Multiple function-template specializations and class-template specializations are instantiated in a program, at compile time, though the template is written only once. These copies can consume considerable memory. This is not normally an issue, because the code generated by the template is the same size as the code the programmer would have written to produce the separate overloaded functions.
