Suppose that class template Employee has a static data member count. Suppose that three class-template specializations are instantiated from the class template. How many copies of the static data member will exist? How will the use of each be constrained (if at all)?

Every instantation will have it's own static data member. In this case we'll have three copy of count.
To use count of int Employee write Employee<int>::count.
To use count of double Employee write Employee<double>::count.
To use count of String Employee write Employee<String>::count.
