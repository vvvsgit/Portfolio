Flight simulator can have base class aircraft which will define some general behaviors, like fly(), land(), getHeight(), getLow(). From class aircraft can be derived many different type of aircrafts, like plane, helicopter, jetplane, blimp, airBalloon. Derived classes will inherit aircraft behaviors and override them depending on their specifics. If there will be need to add some other type of aircrsfts, it's enough to only inherit from base class and implement specific behaviors without changing main class. If there will be need to add or change some generel behaviors, it will only be need to modify base class and all new featuress will be available for all type of aircrafts.
